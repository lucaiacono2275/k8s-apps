# Tell helm to restart (recreate) pods on every deploy. Setting this to true will inject
# `date/deploy-date: <timestamp>` annotation into pod specification for StateFulset. This
# ensures that the Pod is recreated with the new changes.

# Feel free to disable this but doing so **IS IT YOUR OWN RISK**. By disabling this feature
# you might run into issues where some changes are not reflected on the Pod. If you experience
# this with this setting set to `false` the first thing to try out is to restart / delete
# a pod and let `StatefulSet`Â recreate it.
